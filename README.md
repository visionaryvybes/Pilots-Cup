## Providers

Vercel will only be actively maintaining a Shopify version [as outlined in our vision and strategy for Next.js Commerce](https://github.com/vercel/commerce/pull/966).

Vercel is happy to partner and work with any commerce provider to help them get a similar template up and running and listed below. Alternative providers should be able to fork this repository and swap out the `lib/shopify` file with their own implementation while leaving the rest of the template mostly unchanged.

## Integrations

Integrations enable upgraded or additional functionality for Next.js Commerce

- [Orama](https://github.com/oramasearch/nextjs-commerce) ([Demo](https://vercel-commerce.oramasearch.com/))

  - Upgrades search to include typeahead with dynamic re-rendering, vector-based similarity search, and JS-based configuration.
  - Search runs entirely in the browser for smaller catalogs or on a CDN for larger.

- [React Bricks](https://github.com/ReactBricks/nextjs-commerce-rb) ([Demo](https://nextjs-commerce.reactbricks.com/))
  - Edit pages, product details, and footer content visually using [React Bricks](https://www.reactbricks.com) visual headless CMS.

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js Commerce. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control your Shopify store.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

<details>
  <summary>Expand if you work at Vercel and want to run locally and / or contribute</summary>

1. Run `vc link`.
1. Select the `Vercel Solutions` scope.
1. Connect to the existing `commerce-shopify` project.
1. Run `vc env pull` to get environment variables.
1. Run `pnpm dev` to ensure everything is working correctly.

## Local Development

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) in your browser

## Build Script

The included `build.sh` script handles:

1. Creating any missing files and directories required for the build
2. Setting up proper environment variables for optimal build performance
3. Cleaning npm cache to prevent build issues
4. Installing dependencies
5. Building the application

This ensures a smooth deployment process even if some files are missing or misconfigured.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment:

1. Check the Render.com logs for specific error messages
2. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set
3. Verify that the build script has execute permissions (`chmod +x build.sh`)
4. Check that your repository is up to date with the latest changes

For local development issues, try:

1. Clearing the Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`
2. Reinstalling dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
3. Restarting the development server
